# About This Project

This project is a modified version of [`hivemind`](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) by [DarthSim](https://github.com/DarthSim), originally licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

While `hivemind` focused on providing a Procfile-based CLI tool for running and managing multiple processes, this fork reimagines the core functionality as an **API-only library**.

Key differences from the original:

- ðŸ“š **Programmatic API**: Processes can now be managed directly from Go code, without requiring a Procfile.

- ðŸš« **No CLI**: The command-line interface has been fully removed to simplify the focus toward library usage.

This project retains significant parts of the original architecture but is adapted for a different usage pattern.
